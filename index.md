<!-- I’m interested in developing intelligent systems (**trustworthy AI**) that can demonstrate a deep understanding of the world with common-sense knowledge and reasoning ability by teaching machines to think, talk, and act as humans do. To this end, I am really interested in integrating techniques of _<u>information extraction</u>_, _<u>knowledge representation learning</u>_, _<u>graph-neural network</u>_, _<u>semantic parsing</u>_, etc. Besides, I am also interested in _<u>causal inference</u>_, _<u>interpretability and robustness of the ptms</u>_ and _<u>transfer learning</u>_ topics.  -->

## Work Experience

I am currently an intern at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), DKI group, working with [Dr. Mengyu Zhou](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mezho/), and an intern at Dartmouth College, working with [Prof. Soroush Vosoughi](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/index.html) & Ph.D. candidate Weicheng Ma at [Minds, Machines and Society Lab](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/Projects.html) (Convert from Full-time to Part-time since Aug.).

Previously, I interned at [ICT, VIPL Group](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn) from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, working with [Prof. Shuhui Wang](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/people/shwang/) & Ph.D. candidate Xinzhe Han; CAD & VC Group from Shandong Normal University, working with [Prof. Wei Yan](https://sarryyan.github.io/) & [Prof. Liang Zhang](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/zhangliang/en/index.htm).

### Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, VIPL Group

+ No.6 Kexueyuan South Road Zhongguancun,Haidian District Beijing,China
+ Responsibility and contribution (takeaways):
  + Responsible for full project pipeline implementation of KGQA based on semantic parsing, and realize the transformation from query to logical chain to alleviate the semantic hierarchy challenges of the unstructured natural language questions: 1) Spurious entity relations; and 2) Query graph composition; Tuning our seq2seq model to achieve the 85% accuracy shipping bar with the process of intermediate few shots generation, smart idea design and relevant experiments design like hyperparameters searching;
  + Propose a causal interference-based model (causal filter, CF) using clustering methods to reduce the spurious entity relations and missing link problems in KGQA; The new mechanism based on the causal correlations produced by CF increased the performance of KGQA and obtain the SOTA performance on MetaQA (1hop and 3hop), Webqsp and OpenbookQA in 2021, and the results have been published by Knowledge-Based Systems (SCI-1, IF:8.139, first author); Other paper related to semantic parsing is ready to submit to ACL'23.

### Dartmouth College, The Minds, Machine, and Society group

+ ECSC building, 15 Thayer Drive Hanover, NH 03755 (REMOTE)
+ Responsibility and contribution (takeaways):
  + Responsible for building up the pipeline of evaluation probing to investigate the exact content does large language model (LLMs) learn from scratch, like dependency, pos-tagging, and NER.
  + To get the insights of LLMs' structures, conduct head-wise & layer-wise experiments to verify the effectiveness and patterns of each component of LLMs.
  + Try smart ideas on multilingual capabilities of LLMs performance on pos-tagginbg and dependecy-tagging task to verify the impact of language setting.
  + Takeaways: have two related paper being prepared and will submit them to ACL'23.

### Microsoft Research Asia, DKI group

## Activity

During my undergraduate period, I started a school-level robotics lab and recruited 30 like-minded lab members, and we did many interesting things together. For example, we organized an **"open day"** where we invited 20 elementary school students to the lab and by explaining some of the basics of robotics, we hoped to stimulate their interest and exploration of mechanical, computer and scientific problems; Also, we **hosted a reading festival** at the school library which is open to the whole campus. In this festival, We build a book recommendation system by voice recognition, image classification and some other technologies, and we use this system to recommend the prespective books for the participates.
