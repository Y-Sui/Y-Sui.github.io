## Research Interests

I’m interested in developing intelligent systems (**trustworthy AI**) that can demonstrate a deep understanding of the world with common-sense knowledge and reasoning ability by teaching machines to think, talk, and act as humans do. To this end, I am really interested in integrating techniques of information extraction, knowledge graphs, robustness, semantic parsing, etc. Besides, I am also interested in causal inference and transfer learning topics.

## Work Experience

I am currently an intern at Dartmouth College, working with [Prof. Soroush Vosoughi](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/index.html) & Ph.D. candidate Weicheng Ma at [Minds, Machines and Society Lab](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/Projects.html), and I will go for my next internship at Microsoft Research Asia working with [Dr. Mengyu Zhou](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mezho/) at [DKI group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/), starting from Winter 2022. Previously, I interned at [ICT, VIPL Group](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn) from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, working with [Prof. Shuhui Wang](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/people/shwang/) & Ph.D. candidate Xinzhe Han; CAD & VC Group from Shandong Normal University, working with [Prof. Wei Yan](https://sarryyan.github.io/) & [Prof. Liang Zhang](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/zhangliang/en/index.htm).
